######### BEGIN TEAM MEETING NOTES 9/24/2023 #########
Team Meeting 9.24
WHEN: Sunday, September 24th @ 2:30pm
WHERE: The Nest Lawrence, poolside. 
PURPOSE: First team meeting. Decide a team name. Designate & design roles, begin project documentation and organization.
ATTENDANCE: 5/5 --> Michael Stang, Blake Carlson, Logan Smith, Jack Bauer, Holden Vail

--> First, we setup a group chat for general project related discussion and we used / will use the Canvas group to organize our meetings.
--> We began with a discussion as to which roles we may need, what their responsibilities may be, and what methodology our process should follow. 

Agenda Item 1: Role designation:
Team Administrator: Michael Stang
	Responsible for:
		- Organizing & leading team meetings
		- Establishing agendas & setting internal deadlines
		- Ensuring proper communication between roles
		- Coordinating with stakeholders 
		- General team communication with outside entities, in particular in regards to internal relations
		- Assisting where needed
Assistant Team Administrator: Jack Bauer
	Responsible for:
		- Recording team meetings & taking and posting minutes
		- Assisting the team administrator with misc tasks
		- Filling in for the team administrator in extenuating circumstances 
		- Managing the GitHub repository and ensuring completion of deliverables
		- Assisting where needed
Technical Lead: Blake Carlson
	Responsible for:
		- Lead the implementation of the Design Lead's requirements
		- Assign technical tasks to team members but be ultimately responsible for their completion
		- Assisting where needed
Design Lead: Logan Smith
	Responsible for:
		- Lead the creation of design deliverables and design requirements
		- Ensure technical implementations are completed in accordance with design requirements
		- Assisting where needed
Requirements and Quality Lead: Holden Vail
	Responsible for:
		- Lead the Requirement Engineering phase of the project
		- Ensure quality and completion of design and implementation in accordance with designated requirements
		- Ensure tasks are completed by deadlines and follow up with team members to minimize blockers
		- Assisting where needed

--> There was very little disagreement about roles and responsibilities, and so we were able to complete this portion relatively quickly and without any legitimate conflict.
--> We took a short break in order to move locations to charge our laptops.
--> We began the process of deciding on a team name

Agenda Item 2: Team Name
	Ideas:
		- Team 17
		- 17 Co. 
		- Pool Co.
		- pool.io
		- pool.co
		- poolio.co

--> We decided on 17 Co. because our group number on Canvas is 17. 
--> We decided our project name (which may change throughout development) will be "17 Co. Calculator".
--> We began work on our Software Development Plan.
	- We faced some technical difficulties using Microsoft Word's collaboration feature, in particular the internet was unstable and so it took a while for word to update for everyone when one person made changes. But, we proceeded with caution and were ultimately successful despite the inefficiency.  
	- We had a lot of discussions about how to structure the project, and ultimately decided to use incremental phases, based upon the assignment dates of each section in the syllabus, with each Phase including multiple iterations to be implemented and executed by the appropriate lead. For example, the requirements engineering phase and its iterations will be planned and led by the Requirements and Quality lead.

--> We added a variety of responsibilities to be completed before the next meeting:
	- The Requirements and Quality Lead must ensure the creation and initial draft of the Vision Document and plan the requirements engineering phase.
	- The Assistant Team Administrator will ensure the completion of meeting logs and the creation and initial draft of the project glossary.
	- The Technical Lead and Design Lead will ensure the creation and initial draft of project iteration plans. 
	- The Team Administrator will ensure the completion of all tasks and schedule the next meeting and will create a checklist of items to complete, based on the Software Development Plan, at the start of each Phase and each iteration with the appropriate feedback and input from each lead.

--> The next meeting will be scheduled by the Team Administrator in Canvas.

######### BEGIN TEAM MEETING NOTES 9/29/2023 #########
Team Meeting 9.29
WHEN: Friday, September 29th @ 4:00pm
WHERE: The Nest Lawrence. 
PURPOSE: Second team meeting. Planning the requirements specification completion process, and will complete EC Quiz 1 if there is time.
ATTENDANCE: 5/5 --> Michael Stang, Blake Carlson, Logan Smith, Jack Bauer, Holden Vail

--> We began by confirming role knowledge and going over the agenda and objectives for the meeting.
--> We decided, since our last meeting ran for around 5 hours, we will not complete work necessarily during the meeting but will instead assign new tasks for people to complete on their own time
--> Today we begin a new phase, with this phase being lead by our Requirements and Quality Lead: Holden.
--> He needs to complete various tasks as specified in our Software Development Plan, and there are a variety of other plans and documents that must be completed by a variety of other team members, such as the iteration plans. 
--> A few updates must also be made to the Software Development Plan, as specified at the beginning of each phase.
--> Holden suggested we post assignments to individuals through Canvas as needed, so he and Michael will work on completing that, in order to achieve greater efficiency and clarity in tasks. 
--> While we have a shared folder of live documents on Canvas, when versions are completed they will be goldenized and uploaded to GitHub. 
--> Jack will begin the Project Glossary
--> We had a great discussion about what each of us will be responsible according to our roles
	For example: Holden takes in a problem and figures out what features need to be made. Logan takes in those features and designs more high level details such as what classes we need. Blake takes that design specification and figures out how we will implement those technically. We then take that, optimize, fix bugs, etc which Holden will make sure matches our requirements. Michael and Jack organize the whole project.  

Phase 2 Objectives:
- Completion of Software Requirements Specification - Holden leads
- Glossary creation - Jack
- Establish meeting cadence - Michael
- Establish a proper review process - Michael

--> We planned the dates and deadlines for new meetings, work completed, etc.
Backlog (a list of tasks that need to be done to complete the phase) due 10/4
Requirements Specification due 10/13 (due for class on 10/15)
Glossary due 10/13

--> Our next meeting will be October 2nd, 4pm @ The Nest, Lawrence
