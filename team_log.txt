PURPOSE: First team meeting. Decide a team name. Designate & design roles, begin project documentation and organization.
ATTENDANCE: 5/5 --> Michael Stang, Blake Carlson, Logan Smith, Jack Bauer, Holden Vail

--> First, we setup a group chat for general project related discussion and we used / will use the Canvas group to organize our meetings.
--> We began with a discussion as to which roles we may need, what their responsibilities may be, and what methodology our process should follow.

--> There was very little disagreement about roles and responsibilities, and so we were able to complete this portion relatively quickly and without any legitimate conflict.
--> We took a short break in order to move locations to charge our laptops.
--> We began the process of deciding on a team name

Agenda Item 2: Team Name
	Ideas:
		- Team 17
		- 17 Co. 
		- Pool Co.
		- pool.io
		- pool.co
		- poolio.co

--> We decided on 17 Co. because our group number on Canvas is 17. 
--> We decided our project name (which may change throughout development) will be "17 Co. Calculator".
--> We began work on our Software Development Plan.
	- We faced some technical difficulties using Microsoft Word's collaboration feature, in particular the internet was unstable and so it took a while for word to update for everyone when one person made changes. But, we proceeded with caution and were ultimately successful despite the inefficiency.  
	- We had a lot of discussions about how to structure the project, and ultimately decided to use incremental phases, based upon the assignment dates of each section in the syllabus, with each Phase including multiple iterations to be implemented and executed by the appropriate lead. For example, the requirements engineering phase and its iterations will be planned and led by the Requirements and Quality lead.

--> We added a variety of responsibilities to be completed before the next meeting:
	- The Requirements and Quality Lead must ensure the creation and initial draft of the Vision Document and plan the requirements engineering phase.
	- The Assistant Team Administrator will ensure the completion of meeting logs and the creation and initial draft of the project glossary.
	- The Technical Lead and Design Lead will ensure the creation and initial draft of project iteration plans. 
	- The Team Administrator will ensure the completion of all tasks and schedule the next meeting and will create a checklist of items to complete, based on the Software Development Plan, at the start of each Phase and each iteration with the appropriate feedback and input from each lead.

--> The next meeting will be scheduled by the Team Administrator in Canvas.
